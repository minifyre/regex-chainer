# RegEx Chainer

Regular Expressions (RegEx) are great tools for find/replace &amp; match operations.
This tool allows you to easily chain transformations together &amp; bookmark them
for later. To get started, or learn more about regular expressions, visit [MDN's article on Regular
Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).
